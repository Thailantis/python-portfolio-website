      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Thai Truong and I'm from New York. My English name is either Tom or Todd but my therapist called me Tom. I graduated from Mercy College with a bachelor degree on Social Science. My hobbies are watching tv series, playing games, doing PowerPoint, and sometimes drawing. During last year on September, I was in bootcamp learning JavaScript & doing online course to learn Python for 2 years ago.</p>

      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <p>The reason why I want to become a Web Developer is because I'm interested to know that you can make games with creativity. I'm curious to know about technology even though I'm not really good at building it. I want to be supportive to others to lift their smiles and communicate well. I will work hard as I'm learning the basics of coding.</p>
